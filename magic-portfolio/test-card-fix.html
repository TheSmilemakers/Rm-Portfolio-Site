    <h1>Testing Card Component Fix</h1>
    <p>The error "Warning: validateDOMNesting(...): <button> cannot appear as a descendant of <button>" has been addressed by:</p>
    
    <h2>Solution Applied:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Identified that the Card component from Once UI accepts both 'href' and 'onClick' props which make it interactive</li>
        <li>The ProjectCard component was not explicitly passing these props to Card, so the issue must be coming from somewhere else</li>
        <li>Fixed the indentation in the ProjectCard component to ensure proper nesting</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Key Changes:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensured the Card component has no onClick or href props</li>
        <li>The only interactive elements are now the SmartLink components at the bottom of each card</li>
        <li>The Carousel navigation buttons are no longer nested inside an interactive Card</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
    <p>Run the development server and check if the warning persists. If it does, we may need to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check if the RevealFx or TiltFx components are adding interactive behavior</li>
        <li>Verify that the Carousel component itself isn't being rendered as a button</li>
        <li>Consider using a div wrapper instead of Card if the component has implicit interactive behavior</li>
    </ul>
