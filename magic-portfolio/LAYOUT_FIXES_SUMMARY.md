# Portfolio Layout Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Tech Stack Section Layout
**Problem**: Title was left-aligned, grid items potentially overlapping or misaligned
**Fix**: 
- Changed heading alignment to `center`
- Wrapped section in Column with `paddingX="l"` for consistent horizontal padding
- Reduced grid gap from `"l"` to `"m"` for better spacing
- Adjusted card height from 140px to 120px
- Reduced icon size from 40px to 32px for better proportion
- Changed text variants to smaller sizes for better fit

### 2. Project Cards Inconsistent Dimensions
**Problem**: Despite aspectRatio being set, cards had different dimensions
**Fix**: 
- Moved TiltFx inside Card component instead of wrapping it
- Added explicit aspect ratio container div with `aspectRatio: "16/9"`
- Set carousel radius to 0 to avoid double borders
- Added overflow hidden to card for clean edges
- Ensured proper width: 100% on cards

### 3. Text Alignment & Padding Issues
**Problem**: Content pushed to left edge, no equal padding
**Fix**: 
- Added `paddingX="l"` to main container in layout.tsx
- Wrapped all major sections in Column components with `paddingX="l"`
- Changed all section headings to `align="center"`
- Updated Latest Insights section to use Column layout instead of Flex

### 4. Global Layout Improvements
**Fix in layout.tsx**: 
- Added `paddingX="l"` to main Column container
- Added `width: "100%"` to style for proper centering
- Maintained maxWidth of 1440px for large screens

### 5. CSS Enhancements
**Added to custom.css**:
- Grid layout width fix: `[data-grid] { width: 100%; }`
- Project carousel aspect ratio CSS for fallback
- Mobile responsive padding rules
- Ensures Once UI responsive spacing tokens are used
