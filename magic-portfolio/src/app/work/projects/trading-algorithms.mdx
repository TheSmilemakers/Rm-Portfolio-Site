        self.models = {
            'lstm': LSTMPredictor(),
            'transformer': MarketTransformer(),
            'ensemble': EnsembleModel()
        }
        self.risk_manager = RiskManager(max_drawdown=0.12)
        
    def execute_trade(self, market_data):
        signals = self.generate_signals(market_data)
        position = self.risk_manager.calculate_position(signals)
        return self.place_order(position)
```
