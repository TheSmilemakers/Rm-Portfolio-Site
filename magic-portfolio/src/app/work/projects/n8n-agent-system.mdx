## Intelligent Automation at Scale

Designed and deployed a sophisticated multi-agent system using N8N, featuring hierarchical LLM orchestration and RAG-powered knowledge bases for enterprise automation.

## Architecture

### ðŸŽ¯ Agent Hierarchy
- **Master Orchestrator**: GPT-4 powered decision making
- **Specialist Agents**: Domain-specific task execution
- **Worker Agents**: Parallel processing capabilities

### ðŸ§  Knowledge Integration
- Vector database with 10M+ documents
- Real-time knowledge graph updates
- Semantic search with 95% relevance accuracy

### âš¡ Performance
- **10,000+ workflows** executed daily
- **99.9% uptime** with auto-scaling
- **60% cost reduction** vs traditional solutions

## Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Agent Configuration Example
const agentConfig = {
  master: {
    model: "gpt-4-turbo",
    temperature: 0.7,
    maxTokens: 4000,
    tools: ["web_search", "code_execution", "data_analysis"]
  },
  specialists: {
    dataAnalyst: { model: "claude-3-opus", specialization: "data" },
    codeWriter: { model: "gpt-4", specialization: "code" },
    researcher: { model: "perplexity", specialization: "research" }
  }
};
```

## Use Cases Implemented

1. **Automated Research Reports**: 80% time savings
2. **Code Generation Pipeline**: 5x faster development
3. **Customer Support Automation**: 90% ticket resolution
4. **Data Processing Workflows**: 1M+ records/hour
